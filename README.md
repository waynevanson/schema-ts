# schema-ts

Create a strongly typed schema in typescript!

# Why?

There are many libraries for doing this, such as TypeGraphQL and Normalizr, but they're too deep in their iplementation of how the schema is used.

This libraries purpose is to abstract some of it out and allow it to be reimplemented with additional stuff if the dev wishes.

This has normalizr built in mind, so check out normalizer-ts. I will link the repository directly when it's implemented, which it currently is not.
